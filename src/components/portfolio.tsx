                    <ul>
                      <li> I've been talking with friends that are Software Engineers working for actual companies already for the most part
                           without adding much to my portfolio this week. They were helping me with the basics of HTML, CSS and some Typescript. </li>
                      <li> I have watched a couple Youtube videos on HTML like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE&t=1194s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> this one </a>
                           were the explanations were easy to understand and directions were easy to follow. </li>
                      <li> I worked on Git as well. I spent quite some time playing around with shell commands and installing the required software for the course,
                           like NodeJS and Git. I linked everything to VSCode and now I just work from VSCode without the need to open GitHub. </li>
                      <li> I went over all the documentation for HTML <a href="https://htmlreference.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here. </a> </li>
                      <li> I barely went over the documentation for CSS <a href="https://cssreference.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> here. </a> </li>
                      <li> Most of the HTML I wrote for this website either came from <a href="https://marksheet.io/html-syntax.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> here</a>,from the advice of a couple friends on 
                           how to style and make things look "nicer" or from the video mentioned above. </li>
                      <li> Used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_two_columns.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> this</a> website to build a flexbox for my picture and the Introduction to my website using some basic CSS and HTML. </li>
                      <li> Grabbed lots of styling techniques and methods on how to put color and give more shape to my page in <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here.</a> </li>

                      <ul>
                        <li>This week I started watching more videos from week 1 on CSS and advance HTML tags and styling techniques. I learned a couple
                            different tags for both CSS and HTML that helped me organize my portfolio page better.</li>
                        <li>I went over the <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">flexbox practice</a> from canvas and got <a href="img/milestone 2-1.jpg>" target="_blank">this</a>.</li>
                        <li>I checked part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this</a> video out about JavaScript and started some practice on my own like creating classes and stuff.</li>
                        <li>I went over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJSoEo8JSnc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this</a> video about flexbox.</li>
                        <li>Before knowing about React, I was thinking about doing my flashcard game with just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. But now I am just watching videos and gathering some more practice with it before implementing it.</li>
                        <li>I watched a couple React videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKcJxF0lAU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this</a> one, but I think I need some more practice before adventuring into implementing this website in React.</li>
                        <li>I did a revamp of the whole website using CSS. I noticed, and a couple friends pointed out, that the yellow background and red letter was not a good idea so I changed it!</li>
                        <li>Splitted my website into different sections for better control and more design opportunities and added a navigation bar with links to those sections using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwWHL3RyQgk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this</a> video.</li>
