                I major in Electrical Engineering but I developed a passion for coding so I decided to take a minor in Computer Science.
                As of September, 2021, I am a Senior and about to go through a major change in lifestyle after I graduate next Spring.<br />
                In hopes of findign a job and produce for a couple years, I have been developed my skills in many different areas and skills across different fields 
                in order to provide my best to my future employers, and employees if I ever decide to open a company myself.<br /><br />
